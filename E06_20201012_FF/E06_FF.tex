\subsection{Blocks World}
Planning in the blocks world is a traditional planning exercise, and you can recall what we have introduced in the theory course.
\\ There are a collection of blocks: a block can be on the table, or on the top of another block. 
\\ There are three predicates:  
\begin{itemize}

\item\textit{clear(x)}: there is no block on top of block x;

\item \textit {on(x,y)}: block x is on the top of block y;

\item   \textit {onTable(x)}: block x is on the table

\end{itemize}There are two actions in this task:
\begin{itemize}

\item\textit{move(x,y)}: move block x onto block y, provided that both x and y are clear;

\item \textit {moveToTable(x)}: move block x on to the table, provided that x is clear and x is not on the table;

\end{itemize}Give initial state and goal state, find the actions change the initial state to the goal state.
\\

In this task, please complete the file \texttt{domain\_blocks.pddl} to solve the blocks world problem. You should know the usages of \texttt{forall} and \texttt{when}.
