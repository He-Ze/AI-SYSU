\section{Boxman Game}
If you don't know how to play the boxman game, you should open \texttt{BoxMan.zip} and click \texttt{BoxMan.exe} to have a try.  You can also choose the level of the game to challenge yourselves. There are five cases choosed from level 1, 10, 30, 40, 50 in the following figures.

You can model the location information based on rectangular coordinates as mapped out in Figure 3. For example, we denote by P13 the position (1,3). The calculated action sequence can be like this: \texttt{MOVE P12 P13, PUSH BOX1 P14 P15...},which means the guy runs from position (1,2) to position (1,3), and push the box1 from position (1,4) to position (1,5). However, this is only a very simple and intuitive approach to representing the actions and positions. If you have any other better methods, you can have a try.

Please solve the boxman game by using FF planner. You should hand in 2 files, including a domain file (\texttt{boxman\_domain.pddl}) and  data file (\texttt{boxman5.pddl}).
