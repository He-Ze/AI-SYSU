## Ⅰ  Futoshik

> Futoshiki is a board-based puzzle game, also known under the name Unequal. It is playable on a square board having a given fixed size (4 4 for example).
>
> The purpose of the game is to discover the digits hidden inside the board’s cells; each cell is filled with a digit between 1 and the board’s size. On each row and column each digit appears exactly once; therefore, when revealed, the digits of the board form a so-called Latin square.
>
> At the beginning of the game some digits might be revealed. The board might also contain some inequalities between the board cells; these inequalities must be respected and can be used as clues in order to discover the remaining hidden digits.
>
> Each puzzle is guaranteed to have a solution and only one. 
>
> You can play this game online: http://www.futoshiki.org/.
